        "title" => "ISTANBUL",
        "description" => "For more than 1500 years İstanbul was the capital of Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman Empires.

With one arm reaching out to Asia and the other to Europe, İstanbul is the only city in the world built on two continents. The Bosphorus courses the waters of the Black Sea, the Sea of Marmara and the Golden Horn through the city’s heart.

Istanbul’s fate has been sealed by its vital strategic location and its enchanting natural beauty. For more than 1500 years it was the capital of three empires: Roman, Byzantine and the Ottoman Empires. It was beautified accordingly with magnificent monuments and became a metropolis where diverse cultures, nations and religions mingled. Those cultures, nations and religions are the small pieces that form the mosaic of İstanbul.

İstanbul’s most important building works started in the Byzantine period and the city was then embellished further during the days of the Ottoman Empire.

It is İstanbul’s endless variety that fascinates its visitors. The museums, churches, palaces, grand mosques, bazaars and sites of natural beauty are countless. As relaxing on the western shores of the Bosphorus at sunset and watching the red evening light reflected on the other continent, you may suddenly and profoundly understand why so many centuries ago settlers chose to build a city on this remarkable site. At such times you can see why İstanbul is truly one of the most glorious cities in the world.

İstanbul is Turkey’s most developed and largest city, with the latest discoveries indicating that the history of human habitation there goes back some 400,000 years. The purple years of İstanbul may have started in 330 when Emperor Constantine declared the city the capital of his empire – royal purple is the colour of the Byzantine imperial family. Until 1453, when it was conquered by the Ottomans, the city served as the capital of the Byzantine Empire. During the reign of the Byzantines, İstanbul was adorned with a number of great monuments, which made it the most magnificent city in the world, even during the declining years of the empire.

The identity of İstanbul that began with the Byzantines was further shaped during the period of the Ottoman Empire. Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror declared İstanbul the capital of Ottoman Empire after he conquered the city in 1453. Over the next 450 years the city was adorned with superb Ottoman monuments. Building works after the conquest gathered apace during the reign of Sultan Bayezid II, with the finest works built by Mimar Sinan, the Chief Royal Architect. This worldfamous architect put his signature on the silhouette of İstanbul with a number of masterpieces.

The Ottomans were tolerant towards all religions and dedicated many places of worship to the Christian and Jewish communities so that these peoples could practise their religion undisturbed. Thus, in İstanbul mosques, churches and synagogues stood and still stand side by side as the physical evidence of İstanbul and a symbol of tolerance and fraternity of religions.

As an imperial capital of 1500 years, İstanbul is rich in architectural monuments reflecting its past splendour.

At every turn in the city one can happen upon Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman palaces, mosques, churches, monasteries, monuments, walls and ruins. The old city centre, with its places of worship, government, trade and entertainment, was where the citizens mingled, enjoying the benefits of the security and bounty of the state while maintaining their culture and way of life.

The most magnificent of İstanbul’s monuments are clustered on the historical peninsula, the triangular piece of land surrounded by the Sea of Marmara to the east and south, by the Golden Horn to the north and by the city walls to the west. The Historic Areas of İstanbul was inscribed on the World Heritage List of UNESCO in 1985, enchanting visitors with an impressive texture. Sultanahmet Square is the core of the historical peninsula and the most prominent examples of Byzantine and Ottoman architecture can be seen in close proximity here.

Living Heritages of Byzantines

During the Byzantine Period the centre of the city was the Hippodrome and its environs. The Palace was the centre of power, the Hagia Sophia (Ayasofya) the most spectacular of the religious buildings; the Hippodrome served as the common entertainment centre and the Yerebatan Sarnıcı (Basilica Cistern) supplied most of the city’s water, – all are to be found at the centre of the city. During Ottoman times, the square where the Hippodrome once stood became the site for the circumcision ceremonies of the Sultans’ sons.

Great Mystic Symbols

The most glorious architectural heritage of the Byzantine Empire is the Hagia Sophia which is referred to as the 8th Wonder of the World. Aged more than 1500 years old, it is one of the great symbols of İstanbul. The mosaics of Hagia Sophia, which were uncovered after it became a museum, are the foremost examples of Byzantine art of the 9th to 12th centuries. The Kariye Museum (Chora Church) is another Byzantine monument famous for its fine mosaics and frescoes. The Neve Shalom, Ahrida and Aşkenazi synagogues are three of the most important sacred places for Judaism in İstanbul.

The Topkapı Palace is particularly important for the Mukaddes Emanetler Dairesi (Chamber of Holy Relics) where the Prophet Muhammed’s Hırka-i Saadet (Blessed Mantle) and Sancak-ı Şerif (Holy Banner) are kept in their golden chests. The Sultan Ahmet Mosque, also known as the Blue Mosque, was built between 1609 and 1616 and houses the tomb of its founder, Sultan Ahmed I, a madrasah and a hospice.

The Historic Areas of İstanbul, inscribed in the World Heritage List in 1985, cover four main areas: the Archaeological Park, the Süleymaniye Mosque and its associated Conservation Area, Zeyrek Mosque and its asscoiated Conservation Area, and the City Walls of İstanbul. In its evalulation report the International Council on Monuments and Sites has stated that one cannot conceive of the World Heritage List without İstanbul, which has been associated with the world’s major political, religious and artistic events for over 2000 years. The cultural property in this area includes unique monuments and masterpieces of universal architecture, two of which are the Hagia Sophia

Another historical area of İstanbul, on the opposite shore of the Golden Horn, is the former district of Pera, meaning ’the other shore’. Settled by Genoese and Venetians in the 12th century, this quarter was inhabited mostly by Levantines and represented the western face of the city. The cosmopolitan character of ancient İstanbul is reflected in the following buildings there: the Galata Tower built by the Genoese, stately consulates which were embassies before the capital was moved to Ankara, and the art nouveau buildings of İstiklal Avenue. St Antoine Cathedral, a silent and tranquil spot on this avenue, is visited frequently by devout visitors from every religion. Palaces, summer palaces, castles and large mansions built by the Ottomans continue to adorn İstanbul. The Yıldız Palace and the Dolmabahçe on the shores of the Bosphorus were once the residences of the Ottoman Sultans, after Topkapı Palace. İstanbul is also famous for the elegant wooden houses, the yalı, built along the shores of the strait.

A stay in İstanbul is not complete without a traditional and unforgettable boat excursion up the Bosphorus, the strait that separates Europe and Asia. Its shores offer a delightful mixture of past and present, grand splendour and simple beauty.

Grand Bazaar and Spice Bazaar are the two most visited places in İstanbul.",

        "title" => "CAPPADOCIA",
        "description" => "
        The region of Cappadocia is located in the middle of a once-active volcanic area of central Anatolia. Millions of years ago three of its mountains – Erciyes, Hasandağ and Güllüdağ – were active volcanoes; indeed this activity persisted intermittently at least into the Neolithic period according to the prehistoric paintings.

The volcanic eruptions were so strong that in some places the lava was up to 150m in thickness. Over many millions of years, volcanoes, wind, rain and ice sculpted the region which we now know as Cappadocia. As the landscape was eroded, basalt stones remained and formed conical structures with some reaching as high as 45m.

The local people referred to these unique rock formations “fairy chimneys”, a name that has endured throughout the ages. If nature was the first artist to arrange the decor, it was Anatolian man who carved the rock and built houses, churches and over 250 underground cities out of it over the centuries.

Cappadocia offers visitors an extraordinary and lavish banquet of natural wonders that exceed their wildest imaginations. These wonders are elegantly graced with works created by the hand of man. With its unique natural features displaying a harmonious combination of natural and cultural landscape elements, Cappadocia is an enchanting open-air museum and an unparalleled example of the common cultural heritage of humanity.

Cappadocia incorporates the provinces of Aksaray, Nevşehir, Niğde, Kayseri and Kırşehir. For most people, the name Cappadocia suggests the towns of Uçhisar, Göreme, Avanos, Ürgüp, Derinkuyu, Kaymaklı and Ihlara, where the land has been shaped into fantastic forms over the course of millions of years. Fairy chimneys that seem mysterious and cities and houses of worship that extend many meters deep into the earth are all enveloped in an atmosphere that is ethereal and unworldly.

Prepare yourself to take a brief journey into the Cappadocian region, where Mother Nature painstakingly worked miracles that defy the imagination and where the living elements of history, culture, art and society are inextricably linked. A visit to Cappadocia is highly recommended for those who want to bathe in its atmosphere, colours and luminance.

The Cappadocian region has been inhabited since prehistoric times, with the best examples of it having been unearthed at Köşk Höyük in Niğde, Aşıklı Höyük in Aksaray as well as the Civelek Cave in Nevşehir. During the Middle Bronze Age Cappadocia came under the influence of Assyrian civilization due to extensive trade. During this period writing was introduced, too. Researchers have found hoards of “Cappadocian tablets” – clay tablets inscribed with cuneiform writing – whose texts speak of tax regulation, interest rates, marriage contracts, trade disputes and much else besides. The Hattis, Hittites, Phrygians, Persians, Romans, Byzantines, Seljuks and Ottomans were all enchanted by the allure of Cappadocia and left the imprints of their presence here.

Due to its location Cappadocia has been a critical and strategic region throughout the years. Important trade routes, including the illustrious Silk Road, traversed it both east and west and north and south. As a result of this heavy traffic, the region has been a complex web of historical and cultural influences, a region where different faiths and philosophies have met and influenced one another. Cappadocia’s trade and resources were tempting and so the region was frequently invaded, raided and looted.

To protect themselves from such incursions, the locals took to living in the region’s caves and grottos whose entrances could be concealed so as not to be noticed by trouble-making outsiders. Since it might be necessary to lie low for extended periods of time, these troglodytic dwellings eventually became subterranean cities that included sources of water, places to store food and had wineries and even temples. Some of these subterranean cities date back to pre-Christian era.

Sanctuary of Christians

In the early years of the first millennium, groups of Christians fleeing Roman persecution began moving into the inaccessible wilds of Cappadocia seeking refuge. One group which arrived from Jerusalem via Antioch (Antakya) and Caesarea (Kayseri) in the second century settled down in the area now known as Derinkuyu. Finding the soft volcanic tuff easy to carve, they began to expand the natural caves and link them together, creating dwellings, chapels, churches and monasteries through which these people found the peace and security they had so desperately sought.

It is said that there are around 500 churches and chapels in Cappadocia. The variety and artistry of their architecture, layout and decoration are fascinating and amazing. Basilicas with single, double or triple naves, cruciform plans, vestibules, aisles, apses, domes, columns, pillars and more – can be found in these churches, with all having been hollowed out of stone. Many of the churches are also decorated with painstakingly-painted frescoes. The monumental task of restoring, repairing and maintaining these churches and underground cities goes on even while they receive thousands of visitors a year.

The Gallipoli Peninsula is located on the western side of Turkey known as Thrace. It has an ancient Greek and Roman history. However since WWI and the landing of the Anzac Troops on 25 April 1915, it has become a pilgrimage place for Turkish, Australian and New Zealand people, many of whom have relatives who fought and died there.

Of recent years it has become the focus for many young people of those nationalities to discover this very moving part of their history. On Anzac Day people join together for the Dawn Service at the tiny landing strip known as Anzac Cove. Not only on Anzac Day, but every day of the year people make the journey to visit this very moving site. The generous words of Kemal Ataturk written in 1934 are inscribed on a memorial near Ari Burnu Cemetary:

“Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives ….. you are now lying in the soil of a friendly country. Therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and Mehmets to us where they lie side by side now here in this country of ours. You, the mother, who sent your sons from faraway countries, wipe away your tears. Your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace.

		Troy is enchanting and historic place, embracing the cultural treasures of the east and the west, brought to life by the ancient epics.

2018 was declared “Year of Troy” in Culture and Tourism to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Troys addition to the UNESCO World Heritage List.

With over five thousand years of history, Troy has been a fertile source of inspiration for bards and poets, and has gained immortality in the imagination of those who have read her story.

This timeless story, which weaves together themes of power, victory and love, has attracted people for hundreds of years and the many civilisations acquainted with the Troy have been enriched by the descriptions of the legendary Trojan heroes and their exploits.

Troy, which forms a priceless part of the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List, welcomes visitors to be inspired by her magical history and precious archaeological finds.

Geographically, Troy is set at a strategic point, at the crossroads of two continents where trade routes converge. The significance of Troy is not due only to the value of the archaeological finds discovered here, but also to the skill of Homer, the famous bard from İzmir, who immortalized Troy in “The Iliad”. This epic story has proved to have a lasting attraction throughout the ages.

Priam was the patriotic king of rich and prosperous Troy. The strategic importance of his country’s location made it all the more desirable to the colonies. Paris, King Priam&39;s son, was asked by the God, Zeus, to be the judge at the world’s first beauty contest set on Mt. Ida. Aphrodite, Hera and Athena were to be the contestants.

Each of these goddesses offered him a bribe to be chosen as the most beautiful. Hera promised to make him Lord of Europe and Asia; Athena, that he would lead the Trojans to victory against the Achaeans; and Aphrodite, that the fairest woman in the world would be his. Paris chose Aphrodite and awarded her the coveted golden apple. He then travelled directly to Sparta to see Helen, the fairest woman in the world.

Upon seeing Helen, the wife of Menelaus, Paris fell in love with her, and she with him and they eloped together for troy.

Menelaus, supposing that Helen had been abducted by Paris, set off to Troy to take her back with a huge army consisting of hundreds of fleets. This was the cause of the Trojan War, which continued for ten years.

King Agamemnnon was in command of the colonie, which had been waiting for many years for the opportunity to conquer Troy.

The invincible warrior, Achilles, blessed with invulnerability in every part of his body except his heel, entered into the war with the Myrmidons to gain glory. Hector, son of King Priam, was a succesful warrior, astounding all the Achaean kings with his prowess, and a mighty commander who loved his country. Troy could not be captured due to the strength of its walls and the success of Hector, and the war continued for 9 years without any result.

Odysseus, however, understood that they could only capture Troy with the help of a clever strategy. According to his plan, the Achaeans gave the impression that they had given up fighting and were returning home, leaving behind a gigantic Wooden Horse as a gift to the Trojans. The Trojans accepted the gift supposing that it was a votive offering to the Gods and took it into the city walls. The warriors, hidden inside the wooden horse, got out of it at night whilst the inhabitants of the city were asleep and opened the city gate to let the other warriors inside. Thus, they captured Troy and looted the city.

Heinrich Schliemann, who had grown up with the fascinating stories of Troy, began excavations to realize his dream of finding Homer’s Troy on the hills of Hisarlık in Çanakkale in 1871. Following his dream of locating the magnificent treasures of King Priam’s Troyi Schliemann caused extensive damage during his excavations. He also took the priceless artefacts, which he discovered, out of Turkey illegally. In subsequent periods, the excavations were organized systematically and carried out by the teams of Cincinnati University under the supervision of Carl Blegen. Since 1988, the excavation work has been continued by an international team consisting of many archaeologists under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Manfred Korfmann from the University of Tübingen. Restoration work is still being carried out, as well as geophysical and topographic work.

The ancient city of Troy, which has great significance for European history and literature, was declared a Historic National Park with the approval of the relevant Turkish Ministries and added to the World Cultural Heritage List by UNESCO in 1996.

The excavations, carried out in the ancient city of Troy, have brought to light the fact that the first settlement goes back to 3000 BC.

Troy is a 16-meter high settlement mound, like those seen in Anatolia, in the whole of south-western Asia and in the southeast. Due to the convenience of its location, the hill was settled by various civilizations at different times. Excavations have revealed a total of 9 periods of settlement in this ancient city, which was established 5 thousand years ago.

Troy I dates back to 3000-2500 BC, and it is regarded as Early Middle and Late Troy I. The east tower of the city gate of the walls has been renovated to a large extent and it is in good condition. There is a house, know as one of the oldest megaron type of houses, which is constructed to a long and narrow shaped plan, and consists of a portico and a large room with a hearth at the centre of it. In Troy I, the walls were built in a herringbone pattern, which is peculiar to this period and copper and bronze were used to make tools.

Troy II consists of 7 layers piled on top of one another. Each of them has city walls. Wheel-made pottery is seen in this period. Moreover, attractive jewellery made of gold, silver, and electrum, various ornaments and cup forms were found. Archaeological finds reveal that no important progress was made during the settlement period of Troy III when compared to the other settlement periods of Troy.

Troy IV and V date back to 2200-1800 BC. Ruins of houses and walls were found in this settlement  period.  The existence of ceramic artefacts of the early Hellas period indicates that there was a commercial relationship between Troy and the ancient City States on today’s Greek land.

Imported Mycenaean and Cypriot cups, seen in the settlement period of Troy VI, were also discovered in Troy VII.

Troy VII is likely to be King Priam’s Troy where the Trojan War broke out. Traces of a huge fire are seen in this period.

The oldest of the finds in the settlement period of Troy VIII does not go back further than the 7th century BC. This makes us think that after the settlement period 7b 2, the city was either abandoned by its inhabitants or continued its existence as a small settlement until the 7th century.

The excavations, carried out in this settlement period, revealed the magnificent Temple of Athena and remnants of two altars.

Troy IX was built during the Roman Period. The theatre, remnants of a building with mosaic tile to the fore and Bouleuterion of this period are quite impressive.

Bergama is a city whose history dates back 8,500 years, and was made the world’s 999th UNESCO World Heritage City in 2014. It was originally one of the most important and magnificent settlements of the Hellenistic period in the 7th century B.C.. There are Ionian, Hellenic, Roman and Byzantine remains here and has been a center of learning, health, culture and art for literally millennia.

The name of the modern city is derived from its ancient name of Pergamon, which means castle or Fortification.

The Theater & Fair Culture of Bergama

This Kermes in 1937 brought people from all over the country to Bergama. The Kermes festival in which goods were sold with the proceeds going to charity became a critical part of the culture, folklore and tourism for the city. In the 1940s, the healing temple of the “Asclepeion” was turned into a theater.

The Bergama Kermes lasts one week and is held every year during the Spring. In 2018, the Bergama International Theater Festival was held for the first time, including in the ancient theater of Pergamon and in squares all around the city center.

On April 23rd, which in Turkey is celebrated as National Sovereignty and Children’s Day, the International Bergama Children’s Festival is held, and has been so for 22 years.

The Ancient City of Pergamon

The ancient ruins of the city of Pergamon date back to the 8th century B.C. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Pergamon between 282 and 133 B.C. This was the center of the Eastern Roman Empire before it eventually became Ephesus. During this period, the palace, the temple the theater, and many more massive buildings were constructed, most of which remain remarkably intact right up to the present day. Parchment paper was invented in Pergamon, and it was through this medium that literature (and religion) came to spread so quickly all around the world. Excavation into the ancient city began in the 1870s, and the most important parts of this incredible ancient city are teh Acropolis and the Asclepeion.

The Asclepeion: One of the world’s first hospitals

An asclepeion was the name given to a temple of healing during the period in which Pergamon was at its height. Patients would visit and receive healing, which was often more spiritual than physical though both were available.

The asclepeion of Pergamon was the first in the world to use drugs for anesthesia and one of the first with public health policies. There is an amphitheater located in the Pergamon asclepeion, which is rare for health centers of the period, and it seats up to 3,500 people. It’s been recently restored and as a result allows people the viewing experience provided by a modern theater despite being almost 2,000 years old, so catching a show here is quite the experience! So try to catch a show here and see if your mind is healed at the same time, as this whole region was viewed as having therapeutic qualities.

The ancient city of Ephesus is Turkey’s most important ancient city, and one of the best preserved and restored. One can still stroll for hours along its streets passing temples, theatres, libraries, houses and statues. It contains such grand public buildings as the impressive Library of Celsus, the theatre, the Temple of Hadrian and the sumptuous Temple of Artemis which is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The ruins also include public toilets and even a brothel dating mostly from the fourth century BC.

Ephesus is particularly important for faith tourism as it contains the House of the Virgin Mary. It is believed that the Virgin Mary was taken to this stone house by St John, where she lived until her death at the age of 101. The Church of the Virgin Mary, close to the original harbour of Ephesus, was the setting for the Third Ecumenical Council in 431. Two other religious sites worth visiting are the Basilica of St John, built in the sixth century, and İsa Bey Mosque, which is a sample of Seljuk architecture. Ephesus is not just a touristic site. It is home to the International İzmir Festival utilizing its grand amphitheatre, Celsus Library and the House of the Virgin Mary.

As one of the most important centres of the ancient era that is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2015, Ephesus had been inhabited approximately for 9000 years throughout the Hellenistic Era, Roman Period, Byzantine Era, the Period of Principalities and the Ottoman Era. It was a very important port city and centre of culture and commerce. The whole site comprises Çukuriçi Mound, Ayasuluk Hill (Selçuk Fortress, the Basilica of St. John, İsa Bey Bath, İsa Bey Mosque, Temple of Artemis), the House of the Virgin Mary, and of course the ancient city of Ephesus.

		Didyma, an hour’s drive from the city of Aydın, is one of Turkey’s prime holiday destinations. It has a rich cultural heritage, golden beaches, and a coast of intricate coves, each a wonder of nature. The Temple of Apollo in Didyma is one of the largest and best-preserved temples of the ancient world. There are few better beaches on the Aegean coast than the beautiful Altınkum, and it’s easy to hop on a boat trip to one of the picturesque coves to enjoy a swim. Fascinating ancient cities and gorgeous natural wonders await you. Didyma is not a run-of-the-mill summer resort: the tourist attractions are only the start. The vibrant life of the city continues well after the summer season closes down. Large communities of ex-pat Europeans, especially the British, have settled in Didyma, and consequently the shopping centres, market and supermarkets are full of bustling international activity year round.

Didyma’s Greatest Monument: The Temple of Apollo (Didymaion)

Ancient Didyma was home to one of the most famous oracles of antiquity. The sanctuary was part of the illustrious city of Miletus. Visitors anxious for a vision of the future flocked to the “Sanctuary of Oracles”. The Temple of Apollo honoured the god of the sun, arts, music and prophecy. It became one of the most respected oracles of the ancient world, where visitors eagerly listened to cryptic omens of the future passed down by the oracles.

The founding legend of the Temple of Apollo concerns the shepherd Branchos, who learned the secrets of prophecy from the god himself. The temple was originally built in the 8th century BC, and the sanctuary was administered by the Brahchiadae, who claimed descent from the legendary Branchos. Over time the oracles became famous for the accuracy of their predictions, visitors included statesmen from far away nations who consulted the oracle on matters of state and plans for war.

The Persians demolished the temple in 494 BC to punish the Ionian uprising. Following the arrival of Alexander the Great, who stopped in Didyma during his quest to conquer the known world, the temple was rebuilt in a more grandiose fashion. Construction began in 300 BC on the orders of Seleucus, one of Alexander’s commanders, and lasted for many years. The rebuilt temple was even larger than the original and complemented by diverse ancillary structures. When Christianity started to spread in Anatolia the reconstruction work was abandoned, unfinished. The temple was no use to monotheism, and when the local population adopted Christianity oracles and fortune tellers were banned and severe punishments were promulgated against those involved in suspect activities. The new religion banned the oracles from their traditional activities in the sanctuary. Earthquakes chipped away at the structure – including a devastating 14th-century tremor. However, the present day ruins give a strong impression of the temple’s original grandeur.

Today only a few columns stand upright, but the renowned Temple of Apollo was once the third largest sanctuary of the ancient world. The original structure had 124 columns in double file, and the roof was almost 20 metres high. In many aspects, including its original layout, the Temple of Apollo was different from the other temples of the ancient world. The decorations and upright columns that have stood the test of time indicate the meticulous splendour of the temple’s design and execution.

In ancient times, visitors to the temple arrived by sea at Panormos Harbour, which was situated near present-day Mavisehir, and followed the Sacred Way up to the Temple. Both sides of the Sacred Way were lined with statues, many of which were removed in the 19th century. Today the statues are on permanent display at the British Museum. However, a few of the statues have remained in situ and can be seen here today. Along with the temple itself, visitors can see the petrifying Medusa Head, which has become a symbol of Didyma.

Centre of Science, Culture and Arts in Antiquity: Miletus

The ancient city of Miletus is situated on the road between Didim and Soke, near the Balat village of Didim. In antiquity, Miletus was renowned for the famous philosophers it produced. Foremost among them was Thales, who has been recognised as a precursor of philosophy and the sciences. Thales contributed greatly to the development of the natural sciences, astronomy, mathematics and geometry. He correctly calculated the solar eclipse of 585 BC, and developed a theorem that is still used today. Another important philosopher of Miletus is Anaximander who developed ideas about the formation of the universe. His disciple, the philosopher Anaximenes, contributed to the idea of evolution. These philosophers were the pioneers who laid the foundation of the Milesian School, which later formed the basis of the thoughts developed by philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.

Miletus maintained its prime position in science and culture for thousands of years.  The great 6th century architect, Isodoros, who built the magnificent Hagia Sophia cathedral in Constantinople, present-day Istanbul, was born and raised in the city.

Maritime trading propelled the development of Miletus and it became an important centre of commerce. Many ancient structures have reached our times in quite good order. The most prominent of them are the Grand Theatre, with seating capacity for nineteen thousand, the Temple of Athena, and the Faustina Bath, which was one of the largest of ancient bathhouses. The city’s agorae, ports, and temples are also fascinating.

Miletus maintained its strategic importance for centuries and eventually came under Seljuk dominion. After the collapse of the Seljuk Empire, it became the capital of the independent principality of Menteseoglu Beylik. Later still the city was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. The most important structure dating from the era of Turkish domination in Miletus is the Ilyas Beg Mosque, which was built in 1401.

		Pamukkale appears in almost every list of places to be seen before you die and visited by almost two million tourists each year. Pamukkale is a place where nature assumed the role of artist and created such majestic beauty. The white travertine cascades resembling frozen waterfalls and terraces of shallow pools were created by the waters of thermal springs reacting with the air. Its allure first noticed by the Romans. The magnificent Hierapolis ancient city was established near the travertine by the Romans. Those unique travertine and the ancient ruins were inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Pamukkale would enchant visitors at the first sight. Under the spell of travertine Pergamon Kingdom established the Hierapolis city nearby 2.000 years ago. At that era Hierapolis served as a thermal health center and visitors from various parts of Anatolia flocked to the city to receive a balneal treatment in search of health or beauty. In our age, those who seek beauty or health still dip in the thermal pools. You may also enjoy swimming the timeless pools as your ancestors did, and enjoy the majestic sight of the travertine. However, the natural beauty created over thousands of years is so fragile. Therefore only certain areas are open to paddling or dipping. Those who seek a cure should arrange a longer stay at Pamukkale to enjoy balneal treatment, mud baths, and massages in thermal spa resorts around the city of antiquity and travertine city.

The Hierapolis city of antiquity has reached our times in a quite well preserved state. The most frequented structure of the antiquity should have been the Roman Baht House, and at present the same building is used as the archeological museum. Many artifacts were unearthed during the excavations carried out in Hierapolis and other nearby sites of antiquity, and some of the statues and other items are on display in the museum. The ancient theater, temples, monumental fountains, necropolis, agora, and gymnasium are quite well preserved to make you feel travelling 2.000 years back in time. You would find the story of Pluto’s Gate (Plutonium) which was believed to be the Gate of Hell during the Roman Era, very fascinating.

St. Philip Martyrium and Gravesite

In Christianity Hierapolis is a holy settlement. The holiness is attributed to the fact that St. Philip, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ, was martyred in the city. The Martyrium was built by the palace architects in 5th century, and it is a holy pilgrimage site for Christians. The ruins of Cathedral dating back to 6th century contain the baptistery as well as metropolitan bishop’s chapel. The 7th century church is renowned as the Church of Columns (Direkli Kilise) is the other important structure from Christian era. There are several other chapels scattered around the town. Those structures prove that Hieropolis was an important religious centre during the Eastern Roman Empire era. That is the reason why the archaeologists named it as the holy city.

Unique Sunset

Pamukkale provides several unique experiences to its visitors. Enjoying the magnificent sight created by the sunset colouring the travertine in beautiful hues, is an experience worth to extend your visit.

		With ancient cities hidden among forests with oxygen-rich air, Antalya is a holiday paradise offering much more than one might expect.

Antalya was founded in 158-138 BC by Attalus II, King of Pergamon, who named the city Attaleia after himself. Having been inhabited continuously since then, it was encircled by strong protective walls in Roman times. The Byzantines and Seljuks successively occupied the city before it came under Ottoman rule.

Today it is one of the world’s best-loved tourist resorts, with numerous five-star hotels, holiday villages and entertainment establishments. Besides the chances Antalya offers for skiing on the mountains and then descending to the shore for a swim, the proximity of a great number of archaeological sites and ruins enhances its appeal. There are great works of art from different civilizations at every corner of the city. In the picturesque old quarter of Kaleiçi, narrow, winding streets and old wooden houses abut the ancient city walls. When Emperor Hadrian visited Phaselis in Antalya in 130 AD, a beautifully-decorated three arched gate with Corinthian columns was built into the city walls in his honour. It was the only entrance through the city walls. The two towers flanking the gate, as well as other sections of the walls, are standing near the marina. The clock tower in Kalekapısı Square was also part of the old city’s towers. The elegant, fluted minaret of the Yivli Minaret Mosque at the centre of the city, built by the Seljuk Sultan Alaeddin Keykubat in the 13th century, has become Antalya’s symbol. The Karatay Madrasah in the Kaleiçi district, from the same period, exemplifies the best of Seljuk stone carving.

The two most important Ottoman mosques in the city are the 16th-century Murat Paşa Mosque, remarkable for its tile decoration, and the 18th-century Tekeli Mehmet Paşa Mosque. Neighbouring the marina, the attractive late 19th-century İskele Mosque is built of cut stone and set on four pillars over a natural spring. The Hıdırlık Kulesi (tower) was probably constructed as a lighthouse in the second century. The Kesik Minaret Mosque, which was previously a church, bears witness to the city’s long history. The major part of the southern coastline falls within the borders of the city of Antalya. With ancient cities hidden among the trees, lush-green plateaus and forests with oxygen-rich air, trekking routes and beautiful beaches, Antalya is a holiday paradise offering much more than one might expect.

Visitors can also find a number of touristic hotspots along the coastline away from the city centre. Kemer, 42km from Antalya through a spectacular mountain scenery, is the first such spot to the west of the city. This resort town has been carefully designed to blend in with the surrounding scenery and offers an ideal environment for a wonderful holiday. The fully equipped Kemer Marina allows yachtsmen to enjoy the unspoiled bays and beaches on the south of the town. Shoppers will delight in the wonderful range of high-quality souvenirs. A beach promenade with its cafes and shops on the north of the marina leads directly to Kemer Beach which was awarded a Blue Flag. Other tourist centres to the north are Kızıltepe, Göynük and Beldibi while to the south there is Çamyuva and Tekirova.

At the foot of 2575m-high Mt Tahtalı (Olympos), 15km south of Kemer, the three harbours of Phaselis were once major commercial centres. The ruins of aqueducts, agoras, baths, a theatre, Hadrian’s Gate and an acropolis reveal the city’s historical importance. The ancient city of Olympos is situated on the southern side of Mt Tahtalı. Oleander and laurel bushes shade the Olympos Valley, accessible by land or sea. North of Olympos and up from Çıralı Beach is Yanartaş (at a height of 300m) where, Greek mythology tells us, the Lycian hero Bellerophon mounted his winged horse Pegasus and slew the fire-breathing Chimaera.

The Karain Cave, which dates from the Palaeolithic Age, is the oldest known cave where human lived in Anatolia. A single entrance, lit by the morning sun, opens onto three large interconnecting chambers. Although the little museum at the entrance displays some of its finds, most of the artefacts discovered are housed in museums around Turkey, with some of them dating to 160,000 BC. The ruins of the city of Termessos are perched on a 1050m-high plateau, lying on the western slopes of Güllük Mountain (Solymos) within Güllük Mountain National Park that is situated to the northwest of Antalya. A wild and splendid landscape surrounds the monumental traces of this city, and a nature and wildlife museum can be found at the park’s entrance.

Limyra, an ancient Lycian city, can be found 10km inland from Finike via Turunçova. Farther along this road is the Lycian city of Arykanda. It was inhabited by at least 500 BC and was destroyed several times by fire or earthquake. The ancient city of Myra, now called Demre or Kale, is 25km west of Finike. St Nicholas, who was born in Patara, was the bishop of Myra during the fourth century AD, and died there in 345. The island of Kekova, an hour from Çayağzı by sea, gives its name to a whole group of picturesque islands, numerous bays and ancient cities.

Continuing west out of Kekova you come to Kaş, a lovely spot surrounded by mountains on three sides. Swimming and diving are excellent in the clear cool water around Kaş. Along the scenic Kalkan road, Kaputaş has a beautiful beach at one end of the Turquoise Grotto.

A little distance to the west is Kalkan, a lovely small hilltop town that overlooks a tiny bay. The ancient Lycian capital of Xanthos, today in the village of Kınık, and the Lycian cultic centre of Letoon are included on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

		Lycian Tombs and Sunken Cities

Kas (pronounced Kash) is a small fishing village and tourist town located 170 kms west of Antalya. Built on a hill running down to the Mediterranean Sea, it has hot dry summers and mild winters which makes it ideal for growing fruit and vegetables. Although it is still a source of agriculture, tourism now provides its main income.

The Greek island of Kastelorizo or Meis in Turkish, is located just 6 kms offshore and can be easily be visited by ferry.

Although the peninsula has been occupied since the stone age, it appears that Kas was founded by the Lycians. It was a member of the Lycian League and the importance of the town is confirmed by the presence of one of the best examples of Lycian necropolis.

In ancient Greek times it was named Antiphilos and during Roman times it was famous for sponges and timber. After 395, Antiphilos became part of the Byzantine Empıre and in the middle ages it was a titular see. It suffered from Arabic incursions until like other towns it was annexed to Sultanate of Rum under the Seljuks and then later the Ottomans.

In 1923 following the war between Turkey and Greece, most of the Greek population left the town. Examples of abandoned Greek houses can still be seen here.

The tourism boom came during the 1990s and unfortunately this meant an explosion of apartment building and luxury hotels in scenic Cukurbag area west of the town which has somewhat spoiled it’s beauty. However Kas itself remains a pleasant small town with the Tauras Mountains as it’s backdrop.

	“Come, come, whoever you are. Wanderer, worshiper, lover of leaving. It doesn’t matter. Ours is not a caravan of despair. come, even if you have broken your vows a thousand times. Come, yet again , come , come.”

Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rum

The City of Konya

Konya is the largest province and 7th largest city in all of Turkey with a population of over 2 million. It was a historic silk road city as traders made their way through Central Anatolia. It was the capital city for the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum and the Karamanids in medieval Anatolia, and you feel this stately atmosphere pervading the whole city when you walk through it.

The city was mentioned even in the Bible in the Acts of the Apostles (as the city Iconium) and was later an important city in the Persian Empire as well. But the modern city you walk through bears most of its traces from the city’s heyday as a 12th century Seljuk capital. So many of the wonderful history of the city dates back to this period, and the spiritual feel no less so.

It’s also known for the nearby Lake Tuz, Turkey’s second largest lake and provides a large amount of Turkey’s salt. There are many other lakes in and around Konya, and visiting the lakes remains a popular weekend activity for locals.

Beyond that, the nearby Çatalhöyük is one of the oldest settlements in the world, and was named to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2012.

But that’s not what we’re here to talk about today. Konya is truly one of the most spiritual cities in the world, dating back to the period of Rumi and his beautiful spiritual beliefs. Here, rather than a journey through the sights, we’re ready to take you on a journey to the center of your soul. Follow along!

Rumi and Konya

Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi (In Turkish, he’s often known as “Mevlana”, which is a derivative of the word for “master”) was born in the year 1207. He was born farther east than modern-day Turkey, in what today we know as either Tajikistan or Afghanistan. Sufism had been developing for years, and as Rumi made his way to the cultural capital of Konya, his own beliefs and teachings developed into what we are more familiar with today.

As Konya was the site of many of his most important teachings, it’s also the city that he was ultimately buried in. He died here in 1273, though his teachings would suggest that rather than use the word “death,” perhaps the word “rebirth” would be more appropriate. He referred to the day of his death as “Şeb-i Arûs,” or wedding day, ie the day he would be wed to God. To this day, every December the day of his death is marked as Şeb-i Arûs and a week-long celebration takes place in the city of Konya, with travelers coming from all over the world to partake in and watch the sema ceremonies, whirling dervishes, and prayer hymns.

Those who adopt Rumi’s doctrine of sufism are called Mevlevi or dervishes, and they whirl around in a beautiful ceremony referred to as a Sema ceremony in which they whirl and turn in a dance making themselves one with the Earth. This is the ritual that Rumi himself performed in the streets of Konya before his death.

2007 was marked as the year of Rumi by UNESCO, with many different events taking place in Konya and around the world to commemorate his message of peace, love and beauty. The Mevlana Cultural Center was established over a large area and organizes sema ceremonies every evening.

        "description" => "
		Çatalhöyük is a city founded 9,000 years ago, and this UNESCO World Heritage Site is well-worth visiting to see the remains of an ancient (like, REALLY ancient) city. But what makes it so incredibly special? Well, at the moment, Çatalhöyük is the first known city in the world – the first place where surrounding villages came together and formed a central location and began the sort of urban civilization that dominates the modern world.

What we see at this incredible site is a large city (upwards of 10,000 people at its height) where humans came together, and we see not only the practical applications of how houses formed, but also how the roots of art, religion, and culture came to form as our species grew more accustomed to a settled, sedentary lifestyle.

Equally incredible is the sheer success of the city. It existed for over 2,000 years as a city in various forms, a truly incredible feat compared with today’s modern cities who’ve, in most cases, not lasted even half of that. So what is Çatalhöyük exactly? Let’s take a closer look.

Çatalhöyük was settled primarily between 7500 BC and 5700 BC. The name is Turkish, meaning “forked hill”. It’s unknown exactly why this spot was chosen (or why it was eventually abandoned), but a river once flowed between the two hills that make up Çatalhöyük, with the settlement itself built on alluvial clay, making it particularly amenable to agriculture.

The city appears to have been truly residential, with no known public buildings discovered to date. The population probably fluctuated between 5,000 and 7,000 people, hitting a maximum of around 10,000 possibly. Mudbrick houses are clustered very closely to one another, and neighbors likely traded with one another as well as married each other, feuded, helped and ate together, much as we do in modern societies.

There were no streets or paths connecting houses, instead they were very close to each other forming a honeycomb-like maze, with holes in the ceilings or doors which could be reached by ladder to enter. One could walk along the rooftops between houses, meaning that they functioned as practical streets as well as a source of ventilation along the open roofs of the homes.

The rooms of the homes are surprisingly clean, with middens of waste located away from the ruins. The society also appears to have been remarkably egalitarian, with no houses bearing the marks of a nobility. Men and women appear to have been largely equal, and both appear to have shared the tasks of ritual, artwork, farming, hunting and cooking.

It’s clear that as the town developed, so too did its skill in agriculture, undoubtedly with new technology and efficiency discovered over time and ingenious techniques for harvesting and storing developed.

The Art

And as the farming techniques developed, so too did the artwork. The walls of the houses in Çatalhöyük are filled with images and scenes. Many of these designs are the same as you’ll see in more modern kilims, suggesting just how far back these designs can be traced. Scenes include those of a hunt, dance, stars, leopards, birds, deer, and more.

Heads of various animals, particularly cattle, were mounted on the walls. There’s a painting of the village itself, which makes it essentially the world’s oldest known map.

Many of the animal figurines may be reflective a local religion, though it’s now unclear exactly what that might have been. In particular, a sitting goddess figure, very similar to that of the Mother Goddess Kybele which arose in Anatolia much later, dots many of the homes. There are shrines and various other burial grounds that indicate an intricate religion, even if the specifics have been lost to time.

What you can see

Approximately 14 hectares of space are open to the public, including a museum and a tourism office. The Western mound is closed though the others can be viewed. There’s also a nice café for you to relax in and bask in the grandeur of ancient history.

When you enter, there’s a small model that allows you take in all you’re about to see and get a sense for the scale of it all. There are samples of what it might have looked like and copies of the wall paintings that were discovered.

		It subsequently came under Roman, then Byzantine rule before it became the first capital of the Ottoman Empire in 1326 under the command of Orhan Gazi. Many important Ottoman buildings still remain in Bursa.

Known as “Green Bursa”, the city is filled with gardens and parks and overlooks a verdant plain. It is situated at the centre of an important fruit-growing region. Bursa was, and still is, famous for its peaches, silk, towels and thermal springs. Make a point to try the locally invented İskender Kebab, a dish of bread, tomato sauce, strips of grilled meat, melted butter and yogurt! Candied chestnuts are another regional specialty. The tour of the city begins on the east of the city at the Yeşil Türbe (Green Mausoleum). Set in a garden and distinguished by its exterior panelling of tiles, the mausoleum holds the cenotaph of Sultan Mehmet I. Across the street, the Yeşil Mosque of 1424 reflects the new Ottoman, as opposed to Seljuk, aestheticism. A madrasah nearby completes the complex and is also home to the Ethnography Museum. Before exploring this area, stop for a glass of tea in one of the traditional tea houses. Going uphill to the east, you pass the Emir Sultan Mosque in its delightful setting and, after walking through a district of old houses, you reach the Yıldırım Beyazıt Mosque (1391).

The Historic Ottoman Village of Cumalıkızık that was honored with an acceptance to the UNESCO’S World Heritage List and amazes its visitors with its unchanged air of historic scent.

Thirty-six kilometres from Bursa is Uludağ, is one of the largest centres for winter sports in Turkey, offering a variety of activities, accommodation and entertainment. The ski slopes are easily accessible by car or cable car (teleferik). Although December to May is the best time for skiing, Uludağ National Park is well worth a visit at any time of the year for the lovely views and wonderful fresh air.

Bursa, one of the early capitals of the Ottoman Empire, reflects the early period of Ottoman Culture. Cumalıkızık is a village from that period, a place where time seems to have stopped. The village is notable both for its houses, which are excellent examples of the civil architecture of the Ottoman period, also for its friendly inhabitants that revel in the traditional setting. It is a “living Ottoman village” with an unspoiled historical ambiance everyday living, cultural values and natural surroindings where you are sure to step into a time capsule of wooden houses, narrow streets and monumental trees.

		Founded in the 4th century BC by the Macedonian King Antigonus, Nicea was an important centre in late Roman and Byzantium times. In 325 AD the first council of the Christian Church was held, called by Constantine the Great.   Over 300 Bishops from across the Christian World attended. The bibles of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were adopted by the Council as the official gospels of the Christian Church.  Another council was held in 787AD known as the second council of Nicea which dealt with the Mrrwe of the use of Ikons and afterwards were restored to use in the Byzantine Empire. (In 1962 the 2nd Vatican Council described Is Iznik as the third holiest city after Jerusaleum and the Vatican.)   The Seljuk Turks took Nicea in 1081 and renamed it Iznik, but was recaptured by Byzantines 16 years later. Nicea was finally conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1378. During the 16th century, pottery production was introduced and the city became famous for its beautiful tiles which decorate many mosques and palaces throughout Turkey. After its tile production moved to Istanbul and Kutahya Iznik declined and the population today is around 15000 people. It is a lovely small city and we include this on a tour if you are travelling to Safranbolu or Ankara.

		In the 18th century, it was one of the seven largest cities in Europe. Set on a verdant plain of poplar trees near the junction of the Tunca and Meriç rivers, this gracefully historical city welcomes visitors as they make their way to İstanbul and other points east. The people of Edirne trace their origins back to the rule of the Macedonians. The Roman Emperor Hadrian rebuilt the city and renamed it Hadrianople after himself. With the division of the Roman Empire, the Byzantines claimed Edirne. In 1361 Sultan Murat I added it to his empire. The city’s role as the capital of the Ottoman Empire for almost 100 years accounts for its many historically and architecturally important buildings. With its mosques, religious complexes, bridges, old bazaars, caravanserais and palaces, Edirne is a living museum.

Edirne has retained many of its colourful traditions and customs. Every summer the Kırkpınar oil wrestling contests are held at an emerald green meadow in Sarayiçi. Shiny, slippery bodies grapple with each other to decide on the champion wrestler. As you walk through the city and peer into the corners of the grocery stores, you see blocks of white feta cheese, a local specialty. Hardaliye, another of the city’s delicacies, is a grape drink mixed with mustard and marzipan. Scented soaps, earthenware pots and straw baskets from Edirne make good souvenirs. You will also find it difficult to resist the beautiful embroidery work of the local women.

The Archaeology and Ethnography Museum traces the history of the area from prehistoric to Byzantine times and exhibits clothing from the late Ottoman period. At the Turkish Islamic Art

The Selimiye Mosque and its Külliye form a complex including a madrasah or Islamic religious academy, dar-ül hadis (hadith school), timekeeper’s room and an arasta (avenue of shops). Constructed by the celebrated architect Sinan between 1569 and 1575, the Selimiye Mosque and its complex are located in Edirne, the capital of Ottoman Empire before İstanbul. A masterpiece of Ottoman art and in the history of world architecture, the Selimiye Mosque is visible from all parts of the city with its monumental dome and four slender minarets. Besides its unique architectural characteristics, the mosque evokes admiration with its exquisite details in its carved-stone work and marble, glazed tiles, wood carving and mother-of-pearl inlays.

As you walk along Safranbolu’s streets sheltering over 2000 traditional Turkish-Ottoman houses, you will grasp the opportunity of exploring the elegancy of Ottoman housing architecture and of becoming familiar with the traditional lifestyle of its hospitable locals.

Safranbolu, managing to preserve its complete old settlement texture, is home to historical houses grouped in two main areas: The first is the “Bazaar” section that’s mostly used during winter and previously known as the “City”, while the second one is previously known as “Vineyards” and was mostly used during summer time. The locals spent the winter months in the “City”, and they moved to their summerhouses in the “Vineyards” upon the arrival of warmer summer days, however, life in marketplace, the centre of production and trade, used to be lively and hectic through the year.

With thier unique architecture and locations, the houses of Safranbolu give the guests insight into the former Turkish lifestyle. Safranbolu houses were mostly built by the side of the valley for two reasons: the first is to avert the occupation of fertile agricultural lands and the second is associated with the good grace and decency of neighbour relations among the Turkish people. Because the houses were constructed on the slopes, they do not hinder one another’s view and exposure to sunlight. The upper stories supported by buttresses project over the cobbled pavements which were made as inclined to resist flood waters and to minimize humid effect.

Safranbolu adores those who set eyes on its beautiful houses that defy time with their sound stance and reflect an architecture of superior taste in company with fine wooden decoration. Some houses, designed as museums, have an eye-catching wooden artwork on ceilings and some possess an indoor pool to cool the air and to avoid fire.

The name of the town derives from “saffron”, and Safranbolu is where the best quality saffron in the world is produced. The cultivation and care of saffron is very demanding, however, it is worth the effort since it is capable of coloring a fluid one hundred thousand times as heavy as the saffron itself with yellow. Being used in pharmaceutical, food and cosmetics industries, it carries the title of being the most expensive spice in the world.

Safranbolu has made a name for itself with its perfectly-flavoured Turkish delight (lokum), a dessert regarded to be a leading flavour in the Turkish cuisine culture. The reason is, Safranbolu’s lokum is lighter and the mineral-rich natural water sprung from Safranbolu is used in the making of this dessert; which means, you must taste and buy lokum as a gift during your visit to Safranbolu.

		Due to its location in the centre of the country, the region has been a historical junction of major trade routes and a crossroads of migratory streams. The Hittite Empire, one of the superpowers in antiquity, emerged here in Central Anatolia. The Hittites distinguished themselves not only through the civilisations they created, but also through the state structure they evolved and their tolerance and respect for human rights.

Throughout history, Ankara has witnessed battles between powerful armies in quest of domination. The city was an important cultural, trading and arts centre in Roman times and a major trading centre on the caravan route to the east in Ottoman times. However, it had lost importance by the 19th century. When Mustafa Kemal Atatürk chose Ankara as the base from which to direct the War of Independence, it once again became an important centre. By consequence of its role in the war and its strategic position, it was declared the capital of the new Republic of Turkey on October 13, 1923. Ankara, known until that time for its rabbits, cats and goats, became the geographic, political and administrative centre of Turkey, with all the government offices and foreign embassies transferred from İstanbul. This dramatic change profoundly affected the appearance of the city; what was in effect an ancient Anatolian town had to acquire a new personality quickly, a change which was made very successfully. It was no longer the modest Ankara of artisans and small tradesmen, but a city hosting politicians, government officials and foreign diplomats. The first buildings to alter the skyline of Ankara were the Museums of Ethnography and of Painting and Sculpture.

Ankara is located at the crossing point of the routes from east to west and north to south – thus its influence and importance on commercial routes dates back to such very early times as the Assyrian Trade Colonies Period.

Moreover it was located on King Road which was one of the most important routes in ancient times, extending from Sardis, capital of Lydia, to Susa City in Mesopotamia. Ankara had been used as a settlement area continuously during the Phrygian, Galatian, Roman and Byzantine periods, and Alexander the Great was one of the most famous people that the city hosted. Ankara also came to the fore for its mohair obtained from Angora goats during the Ottoman Empire and became one of the important trade cities of the empire owing to its location on the Silk Road. Although the city entered a stagnant period alongside the general decline of the Ottoman Empire, it gained a new importance with the proclamation of the Turkish Republic and developed swiftly as the capital city that today is the second biggest metropolitan city in Turkey.

While in Samanpazarı visit the Museum of Anatolian Civilisations, a museum considered to be one of the most notable in the world. It is housed in two refurbished Ottoman-era structures: One is a 600-year-old caravanserai, the Kurşunlu Caravanserai, and the other is the Mahmut Paşa Bedesten (a covered bazaar and strong structure built for the safekeeping of valuable commercial goods). A visit to the museum is the best way to be amazed by the splendours and riches of Anatolia’s long history which goes back to the 7th millennium BC.

The Temple of Augustus, Column of Julian and the Hacı Bayram Mosque are also popular sites in Ulus that you should not miss visiting. The Temple was built by the Galatian King Pylamenes in 10AD as a tribute to Augustus, and was re-constructed by the Romans on the ancient Ankara Acropolis in the 2nd century. It is important today for the “Monument Ancyranum”, the sole surviving political testament of Augustus, detailing his achievements and inscribed on its walls in Latin and Greek. In the 5th century the temple was converted into a church by the Byzantines. Erected in 362AD, most probably to commemorate a visit by the Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate, the Column of Julian stands 15m high and has a typical leaf decoration on the capital. Next to the Temple of Augustus is the Hacı Bayram Mosque; it was built in the early 15th century in Seljuk style and was subsequently restored by Sinan in the 16th century. In the 18th century ceramic tiles were added.

Located among the oldest settlements of Ankara, Hamamönü earned a new profile with the restoration projects that deemed it worthy of an award, and it has become a place that attracts most of the domestic and foreign tourist visits in Ankara. It reflects the style of urbanization and architectural features of the Ottoman period and the early years of the Republic. Also worth a mention is the Karacabey Turkish Bath, Taceddin Sultan Mosque and the Hacı Musa Mosque. There are also many restaurants, cafes and patisseries where you can try different types of food from Turkey’s various regions in the historic ambiance of Hamamönü.

Ankara’s most important monument is undoubtedly the eternal resting place of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the modern Turkey.

This mausoleum, built between 1944 and 1953, is a magnificent, neo-classical building appropriately designed with sombre lines and set on a vast esplanade. The entry to the mausoleum, known in Turkish as Anıtkabir, is provided through a triumphant alley lined with granite lions. It is a fitting monument to the greatness of the founder of modern Turkey. There is a museum housing a wax statue of Atatürk, writings, letters and items belonging to him, as well as an exhibition of photographs recording important moments in his life and in the establishment of the Republic.

One of the most important Phrygian sites in Anatolia is the ancient city of Gordion. Situated about 90km southwest of Ankara in the village of Yassıhöyük, Gordion was first inhabited in the late 3000BC. It has various layers of settlement belonging to the Hittites, the Phrygians, the Persians and the Romans, and according to legend the man who made Gordion a capital city for the first time was the Phrygian King, Gordias in the 8th century BC.

The ancient Gordians buried their deceased in tumuli and over 80 of these lie scattered across a large valley to the east of the village of Yassıhöyük. These ancient tombs vary in size and were originally built out of wood covered with a large pile of earth. The largest tumulus in Gordion is believed to be that of King Midas; it is the second largest tumulus found in Anatolia at 300m in diameter and 55m in height. A male skeleton, wooden tables, large cauldrons, bronze containers in various sizes and fibulas, lying beside the head of the skeleton, have been found in the burial chamber which was made out of wood and enclosed on four sides. Most of the artefacts recovered in the Gordion excavations are on display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilisations and at the Gordion Museum.

According to the famous Gordion legend, the Phrygians were in search of a new leader and they were told by an oracle to crown the first person to enter the city on an ox-cart. That person happened to be Gordias, whose ox-cart then got tied to a column by a knot of ivy. The ox-cart then became the focus of another legend, as it was said that the one who managed to untie the knot would become the ruler of Asia. In 334BC Alexander the Great made his way to Gordion to try and undo the knot. Unsuccessful, the impetuous Macedonian king drew his sword and cut the knot in two, going on to fulfil the prophecy by conquering much of Asia. However, his untimely death at the age of 33 was thought by some to have been caused by his unorthodox method of undoing the Gordian knot.

        "description" => "
		Located within the boundaries of Boğazkale District, southwest of Çorum, Hattusas had served as the capital of the Hittite Empire for 450 years, between 1650-1200 BC, extending over a 180-hectare rough and rocky terrain. During the Hittite Empire, this magnificent city used to be surrounded by 6 kilometers long city walls with high towers at certain intervals. The monumental gateways through these walls made entries and exits possible at old times. Such gates as Aslanlı Kapı (which has lion statues on it- so to say, the Lion’s Gate), the Sphinx Gate and the Royal Gate are decorated with reliefs indicating a high talent and taste of delicate stonemasonry. At the farthest southern point of the city, the walls passes over a piled earth level considered to be the city’s crown. Just beneath the Sphinx Gate standing at the central point here, a potern tunnel of 71 meters was formed. The restoration works carried out there up to now with an original system has transformed the ancient capital city, which still stands up against the pressure of time, into an open air museum.

The Hittite Empire ruled across a wide geography, dominating lots of people of different origins. With this attempt seen as a political preference, the gods of different communities were brought together under an official pantheon. In so doing, different communities under the dominance of Hittites were made to live together under a central power. Together with their unique cultural elements, the Indo-European Hittites had adopted many other cultural details of various cultures they met and found acceptable to their own while defining themselves as the Nation of One Thousand Gods. Hattusas was not only the administrative capital but also the religious centre of the whole Empire. As one of the leading 31 temples of Hittites, the Great Temple (Büyük Mabet) was the place wherein they worshipped two gods they considered as the most powerful- Storm God of Hatti and the Sun Goddess of the Arinna City. As the most impressive centre of divinity, Yazılıkaya Open Air Shrine was especially used for the new year celebrations during spring months. The leading gods and goddesses inscribed, in series, onto rocks best reflect the religious diversity of the Hittites. Since the lands of Anatolia being the passageways between the East and the West were under the control of Hittites, the mythological stories created by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia were first carried to Hittities from Hurrians. And then, Hittites took them further and transported them to the Ancient Greek Civilization.

Hattusas on UNESCO’s World Heritage List

Hattusas was inscribed to the World Heritage List of UNESCO in 1986. Some of the reasons why Hatussas was added to the World Heritage List of UNESCO are as follows:

Hattusas represents a matchless artistic success with its ruins as well as with the Lion’s Gate, the Royal Gate and Yazılıkaya Open Air Shrine,

Hattusas established a strong dominance over Anatolian and Northern Syrian civilizations in the first and second millennia BC,

As a political and religious capital, it displayed a comprehensive appearance with palaces, temples, trade centres and such,

Hattusas was the sole witness of the collapse of the Hittite Civilization and last but not least, this ancient capital has perfectly preserved some groups of structural and architectural artworks such as King’s Palace, temples and some other building foundations.

Furthermore, the cuneiform tablet archives of Hattusas that symbolize the oldest recorded Indo-European language became involved in UNESCO’s Memory of World Register in 2001. And so, Hattusas still enjoys the privilege to be the first, and for now, the last asset placed in both cruical lists of UNESCO.

		Previously known as Smyrna until 1930 when the name was changed to Izmir, this city is one of the oldest settlements of the Mediterranean basin. Findings of recent excavations bear traces of Neolithic settlements pre 7-8 Century BC.  By 1500BC the region had come under the rule of the Hittite Empire. Invasions from the Balkans people destroyed much of the area after which it fell into what is known as the Anatolian period. The city came under both Lydian and Persian rule and was then captured by Alexander the Great around 340BC who re-founded the city on a new location beyond the River Meles. It is argued that Homer, also known as Melesigenes was born in Smyna and the River Meles located within the city limits still carries the name.

		Marmaris was, in ancient times, known as the town of Physkos. There has been a castle there since 3000BC. In 334BC Physkos was invaded by Alexander the Great and the castle was besieged with the towns population scattered to the hills. The current name of Marmaris derives from the Turkish word mermer, meaning marble. This is because of the rich deposits of marble in the area and the role the towns port played in the marble trade.

In later times for many years the Knights of St John on Rhodos withstood various onslaughts from the Ottoman Sultans. In the 15th century, when Suleyman the Magnificent set out for the conquest of Rhodos he used Marmaris as a base for the Ottoman Navy and rebuilt the Marmaris Castle from scratch in 1522.  In 1975 Lord Nelson and his fleet sheltered in the harbour en route to Egypt to defeat Napoleon’s armada. With its magnificent harbour and beautiful surroundings set amongst mountains, today’s Marmaris is a haven for yachting and tourism. Little remains of the small fishing village it became after its tumultuous past.

It is now one of Turkey’s most popular resort towns attracting mainly British holiday makers on packaged holidays. It is a stunning setting with pine clad hills jagged inlets further out of the main town.  However most people go for sea, sun, and fun and there are many 3 star resorts used mainly by families and couples who go for the nightlife. It is the main center for sailing and has two major marinas for the hundreds of cruise and sailing boats.

Nowadays, the city is surrounded by some of the world’s most stunning beaches, has a harbour with many boats, a vibrant city life, and delicious cuisine.

The fish market right in the middle of the city is one of the most popular places for an evening meal, where you can literally see the fish you’re about to eat and have it grilled right in front of you at any number of different establishments. But the city has cuisine for any taste and its marina is perfect for an evening stroll.

Ölüdeniz

The white sand beaches and turquoise waters of Ölüdeniz make for one of the most breathtaking natural spots to see – or swim in! – anywhere in the world. Paragliding over this stunning sight allows you to see it in all its glory. You’ll see every inch of the famous blue lagoon, and given that there are very rarely many clouds in the sky, the views for miles over the Mediterranean are almost always stunning.

Fethiye Museum

As Fethiye is the starting point of the Lycian Way and a central point for so many ancient cities, it’s no surprise that its museum has many incredible artifacts from the Persians, Greeks and Romans.

Butterfly Valley

Hundreds of species of butterfly make this cove their home. It’s only accessible by boat, and the beach and steep cliffs overlooking it are simply unbelievable.

Hatay is home it ancient Mesopotamia, where multiple religions rose up, and where civilization as we know it today originated.

And there’s so much to see, a home to all three of the great monotheistic religions, an important province to the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans and the Ottomans. And, set right on the shores of the Mediterranean, it’s also a beautiful spot surrounded by incredible natural scenery. It comes as no surprise, then, that this beautiful nature and the fusion of millennia’s worth of civilizations has led to a cuisine that is out of this world as well!

The Home of History

This 3rd century sarcophagus, known in Turkish as the “Antakya Lahdi,” is an incredible ornate tomb whose marble work looks as if it was sewn on, featuring a reclining figure on its lid. It is a Sidemara type sarcophagus, named after the town where this time of sarcophagus was first discovered.

The sarcophagus is quite large and almost completely undamaged, a work of art that would stand the test of time in any age of history, though two of the statues’ heads are missing. Three people were buried inside the sarcophagus, a man and two women. We do not know their identities.

Church of Saint Peter

This church is one of the world’s oldest, and it’s believed that it’s mentioned in the Bible itself and Paul passed through here. Now, this cave church plays host to pilgrims who pass through. Some mosaics remain from its earlier days, though its current form was rebuilt in the 19th century.

		For centuries Gaziantep has become a meeting place for the naturalists, historians, archaeologists, enthusiasts of adventure and for the ones who are in love with art, devotee of nature and wanderers of cultural values. It is particularly well-known throughout Turkey for its excellent pistachios and rich gastronomy. Its gastronomic connections to the ancient past have contributed much to the formation of the city’s cultural identity.

Designated UNESCO Creative City in 2015.

Rooted in the local economy as a major driving force, gastronomy is also an important element in creating intercultural dialogue and social cohesion, thus placing the city in UNESCO’s Creative Cities Network. Lahmacuns (a delicious pizza topped with spicy meat and herbs), İçli Köfte (a kind of meatball that has been cooked with a paste made of cracked wheat and meat and then fried) and baklava (a honey and nut pastry in Turkey) are only three of many delicacies that will delight both the palate and the eye.

The city hosted many civilisations throughout history and it has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The discovery of sumptuous mosaics in the ancient city of Zeugma nearby has contributed not only to the cultural richness of Turkey but also to the cultural heritage of the world. One of the largest mosaic museums is to be found here and the pieces from Zeugma, in particular the world-famous gypsy girl mosaic, astonish the visitors.

The city’s castle was originally built as a watchtower in the Roman Period. But today’s appearance dates from the Justinian era. The Archaeology Museum has important artefacts from Neolithic, Hittite and Roman times. The Hasan Süzer House, from the turn of the century, was beautifully restored as the Ethnographical Museum. The artisans of Gaziantep specialize in copperware and furniture inlaid with mother-of-pearl.

In the west of Gaziantep, the Dülük Forest makes a good day’s outing or you can stay overnight in the campsite. Enjoy strolling through the archaeological site in the woods which dates back to prehistoric times! A Hittite school of sculpture is centred there in Yesemek where more than 300 works of art still reflect the beauty of the Hittite period. Kargamış, close to the Syrian border, is another important archaeological site that once served as a late Hittite capital on the banks of the Fırat River. The site’s finds including immense basreliefs are on display now in the world-famous Museum of Anatolian Civilisations in Ankara.

Home to the beautiful Roman mosaics, the ancient city of Belkıs (Zeugma) is along the Fırat River on the edge of the county of Nizip. At the junction of the Fırat River and Merzimen Creek, there is Rumkale on a rocky hill which bears a special importance for Christianity as it is believed that this is where St John copied and edited the drafts of his gospel.

		The haunting sculptures overlooking Mount Nemrut are some of the most magnificent that you’ll find anywhere in the world. Giant heads built in the 1st century B.C. under the Commagene Kingdom look out over an incredible sunrise and sunset every day. These massive sculptures are like just about nowhere else in the world, weighing at 6 tons and are a full 10 meters tall.

But where do these mysterious sculptures come from? What is the Commagene Kingdom? Who was King Antiochus I Theos?  Why were they built? What purpose do they serve? And why on this spot? It’s one of the few examples in history where we have the remnants of the history and not the memory, so it’s up to us to set the record right and discover the history of this land all over again.

What was the Commagene Kingdom?

This kingdom was an ancient Armenian kingdom that essentially served as a buffer state between ancient Rome and Persia. In fact, the kings of Commagene claimed ancestry from Darius I Persia.

Its capital was the grand city of Samosata, of which just about nothing remains. The valley at the bottom of Mount Nemrut is likely the location for the city. As you can see, even the known history of the kingdom is a little shrouded in history, but it’s reckoned that the kingdom remained relatively independent until 17 AD, when it was conquered by the Roman emperor Tiberius. It regained independence for a couple decades before being incorporated in the Roman Empire once and for all in 72 AD by the emperor Vespasian.

The kings of the kingdom appear to have been extremely powerful and wealthy, and certainly the sculptures and Mount Nemrut speak to this.

Wait, so what are the sculptures exactly?

The sculptures were built by King Antiochus I Theos of Commmagene as a tomb-sanctuary for himself. The sculptures are of himself, of himself, two lions, two eagles and various Greek, Armenian, and Medes gods, such as Zeus-Aramazd or Oromasdes (associated with Zoroastrian god Ahura Mazda), Hercules-Vahagn, Tyche-Bakht, and Apollo-Mihr-Mithras.

The sculptures themselves show the “East meets West” nature of the kingdom, as the facial features are Greek but the clothing they’re wearing is decidedly more Eastern. They are no longer standing in their original positions, but the scattered effect of the sculpture’s current positions is almost more jarring than if they were neatly in a row as they almost certainly were originally intended.

	The City That Changed Human History

Predating Stonehenge by 6000 years, Şanlıurfa’s Göbeklitepe upends the widely-held views on the rise of civilization.

With a history of 12,000 years, Şanlıurfa, thought by some to be the ancient city of Ur, proudly exhibits the legacy of all the civilisations that have prospered in the region. The city was originally called Urfa but later awarded the title “Şanlı”, or “glorious”, for the role it played during the Turkish War of Independence in the 1920s.

In ancient cities such as Harran and Soğmatar, history going back millennia was established through studies and excavations. Many other monuments of ancient civilisations, which have remained buried for thousands of years, are being brought to light one by one by archaeological workings throughout the city. Among them are the Neolithic Age settlements in Nevali-Çori in the county of Hilvan, the Chalcolithic Age settlement dating to 5000 BC in Kazane near the city centre and the artefacts dating from 10.000 BC in Biris cemetery in the county of Bozova. These studies have already proven the status of Şanlıurfa as a cradle of civilisations and the ongoing excavations will perhaps unveil historical facts that trail even further back in time.

Şanlıurfa, with its wealth of biblical associations, is known as the “Jerusalem of Anatolia” and regarded as a holy site by Jews, Christians and Muslims alike. According to the Old Testament, the Prophet İbrahim (Abraham), “the father of three monotheistic religions”, was born in the city of Ur and he, together with his family, migrated to Harran- the “home of the patriarchs”.

In the lands of Şanlıurfa area was once a city of a Hurrite state in the second millennium BC. Some believe that Abraham was born in a cave near a place where the Mevlid Halil Mosque stands now. The site and the cave itself are, therefore, regarded as sacred.

The remains of a castle with two Corinthian columns rising above the ruined walls stand atop a small crest. At the foot of the hills, the lovely Halil-ür Rahman Mosque is built around Balıklıgöl lake- the living space of the sacred carps. The 17th century Ottoman Rıdvaniye Mosque and the Fırfırlı Mosque, formerly the Church of the Apostles, are worth a detour. The Archaeology Museum, one of the best in Turkey, houses important Neolithic and Chalcolithic finds from the Lower Fırat Region. To capture the spirit of Şanlıurfa wander through the vaulted eastern bazaar and linger in the courtyards of the old hans (inns) and don’t forget to drop in Gümrük Hanı and Barutçu Hanı – the most interesting of the old hans!

The city is closely associated with the Balıklıgöl, which is actually made up of the Halil-ür Rahman and Ayn-ı Zeliha lakes. Right adjacent to these lakes stands the Rızvaniye Mosque. It is believed that King Nemrut cast the Prophet Abraham from the castle into the flames and God turns the fire into water and the woods into fish, hence the creation of the Halil-ür Rahman Lake. After falling in love with Prophet Abraham, Nemrut’s step-daughter Zeliha jumps into the fire which subsequently changes into the Ayn-ı Zeliha Lake.

 

Believed to be the ancient city of Haran mentioned in the Old Testament, Harran is today known more for its unusual beehive dwellings than as the place where Abraham the Prophet spent several years. It used to be known as Helenopolis that was burned and destroyed by Mongolian invaders in 1260. Included among the archaeological finds are those of the oldest Islamic university, city walls dating from the eighth century, four gates and a citadel.",

		First Temple of the World

There are substantial grounds to claim that the most significant archaeological discovery of the 21st century is the Göbeklitepe. First of all, it dates back to 12 thousand years ago. In other words, it’s approximately 8 thousand years older than the pyramids and 7 thousand years older than the Stonehenge. Furthermore, it is even older than the human transition to settled life. Therefore, contrary to the widely held view, it proves the existence of religious beliefs prior to the establishment of the first cities.

Findings of researchers at Göbeklitepe shows that a religious class existed even at such early ages, division of society into social classes took place well before the widely assumed dates, and perhaps the first agricultural activity may have been conducted in the region. The site is also remarkable with the first patriarchal thought, the first terrazzo flooring and the first statues and reliefs of the Neolithic Age. As a result, all this new information has been added to the collective knowledge of humanity and into the history books. On the merits of its contribution to human history, Göbeklitepe was inscribed to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2018.

Discovery That Changed The Human History

While the discovery of Göbeklitepe site took place in 1963, the first scientific excavation started in 1995, eventual findings of which added new pages to the history, changing long standing assumptions. Rather than being used as a settlement, the area actually served religious purposes and contain a number of temples. In that respect, it is not only the oldest centre of worship, but also the largest one. Although six of those temples were unearthed to date, on the basis of geomagnetic surveys, the total number of those monumental structures is believed to be twenty, with all temples sharing a resemblance to each other, making this entire region suggestive of being a centre of faith and pilgrimage during the Neolithic Age. There are six-metre-tall T-shaped stone pillars, carved with reliefs of animals, erected to form circles. Those carvings that maybe the earliest three dimensional depictions of animals carved into stone are testament to the artistic ability of our ancestors. Professor Klaus Schmidt, who had led the excavation work in the site for 20 years, firmly stated that the T-shaped stone pillars represented human figures since some of them have carvings of hands and fingers.

Followed by the World

Since unearthing the monumental structures, Göbeklitepe attracted attention of the world, and many articles about it were published and many documentaries were produced. The BBC broadcast a documentary and The Guardian published an article, yet the most striking comments were published by German weekly Der Spiegel. The journal had a sensational suggestion: the Göbeklitepe was the place where Adam and Eve settled after being banished from the Garden of Eden. The journal based its suggestion on the coincidence that the land surrounding the Göbeklitepe is proven to be the place where wheat was cultivated for the first time, and the Bible says that Adam was the first to cultivate the wheat after he was banished.

Unanswered Questions

While Göbeklitepe revealed many important points, there are still questions waiting to be answered by the scientists. By whom those temples were built? How were those 60-ton stone pillars carried and erected? Why were they buried with tons of rock and earth? What was the actual purpose for which they were constructed? These are outstanding mysteries which will probably be resolved following years of further study. What we know for certain is the fact that future findings in Göbeklitepe will continue furthering knowledge about human history, and revise the accepted discourse.

		Mardin is one of the few cities in the world wherein the entire city has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is because just about every inch of the city oozes history and culture, and these lands along the Tigris River have been the crossroads of civilizations since the dawn of civilization itself.

But it makes sense, the entire city is essentially an open-air museum. Most of the city’s buildings use beige colored limestone rock which has been mined for centuries in local quarries.

The city’s history goes back at least until the 14th century B.C., when it was an important spot in the Middle Assyrian Empire and known as Izala, its Persian name. It’s been more or less continuously a cultural hub of the region, and there are traces in the city from Muslim, Syriac, Yakubi, Chaldean, Nesturi, Yezidi, Jewish, Kurdish, Arab, Chechen, Armenian influences,  as well as many more obscure religions and ethnicities.

So when you go what should you see? Here’s a few of the sites in Mardin waiting for you when you visit.

Mor Hananyo Monastery

Officially called the Cayro d-Mor Hananyo Monastery, this Syrica Orthodox Monastery is still practicing and is actually located 3 kilometers south of the city in a region known as Tur Abdin. It’s also called the “Saffron Monastery” due to the warm colors of the stone used to build it.

The monastery dates back to the 5th century A.D. It was renovated in the 8th century and its name derives from then. The monastery is massive, with 365 rooms – one for each day of the year (no, they don’t build another room into the monastery for leap years.). The church is famous in part because it is one of the few places on Earth that still uses Aramaic, the mother tongue of Jesus, as its liturgical tongue. Services are held daily, and the prayer room may date back over 4,000 years.

Mor Gabriel Monastery

Mor Gabriel is another gorgeous 4th century monastery located near Mor Hananyo in Tur Abdin, and it’s the oldest surviving Syriac Orthodox monastery in the world. It is still practicing today, with monks tending to local gardens and you can even stay within the walls if given permission, though it’s closed after dark every day.

The Ancient City of Dara

This ancient Roman city held a great deal of strategic importance during the Roman era, and it was the focal point of Roman-Persian conflicts well into the 6th century, including the famous Battle of Dara in 530 A.D.

It also holds great religious importance as it’s listed by the Catholic Church as an official titular see, for the Latin and Syriac Catholic Church.

You can walk through most of the ruined city, past the stunning cisterns and rock cut buildings. The history and spirituality of this city is evident every step you take.

The Grand Mosque of Mardin

The most iconic shot of Mardin is that of the minaret of the Grand Mosque of Mardin, reaching up into the sky overlooking the whole city. The mosque was constructed in the 12th century and its round minaret is one of the most striking you’ll ever see. Originally the mosque featured two such minarets, bu the other one was destroyed years ago.

        "title" => "MIDYAT",
        "description" => "
		9th century BC Assyrian tables refer to Midyat as Matiate or city of caves because its earliest inhabitants lived in nearby caves. Many different empires have ruled over Midyat – the Mitannians, Assyrians, Urartus, Persian Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Abbas’da Seljuk and finally the Ottomans. Its Syrian name was Tur-Abdin.

There have been various invasions of Mongol and Turkish tribes up until the 20th Century and in WWI many of the Assyrian population was severely decimated. During the 1960s many Syriac people left for a better life in Western countries and Kurdish people have since made their homes here. Just a few Syriac people remain here and have been joined by Syrians now seeking refuge from the current troubles in Syria

Although Midyat now has modern development, the old town has a network of narrow streets with beautiful old sandstone houses influenced by Arabic architecture, many of these have decorative facades. The highest point of the town is the much filmed Konykevi. There are many Syrian Orthodox churches, most of which now lay empty. However services are held in Aramaic – the language of Jesus – at nearby Mor Abrohom and Mor Gabrşel Monasterıes 20 kilometres from Midyat.

40 kms east of Midyat on the Tigres River is Hasankeyf, declared a national conservation area by the Turkish Government but is at the moment at risk of being flooded for the Ilisu Dam Project. Worldwide efforts are underway to conserve this ancient town. The history goes back to 1800BC. With its bridge over the Tigres, the Citadel,and Mosques Hasankeyf, Midyat is an amazing place to visit.

		Being famous for its distinctive domestic cats, Van offers a ferry trip to a sacred destination- an evil eye bead for Turkey’s largest lake.

This remote but important city is settled in a verdant oasis at the foot of a rocky peak. An imposing ninth century BC citadel overlooks the new and old parts of the town. Steps carved in the rock lead to the Urartian fortress and halfway up inscriptions in cuneiform pay homage to Xerxes. Inside of the fortress are several Urartian royal rock tombs. In the old city the Ulu Mosque, Hüsrev Paşa Mosque, Kaya Çelebi Mosque and the İkiz Kümbet (Twin Mausoleums) reflect the Seljuk and Ottoman architectural styles. Van’s interesting Archaeological Museum is in the new city, inland from the uninhabited old district. Still very much part of a traditional lifestyle, the women of Van produce beautiful kilims (rugs) woven in blue, red and white patterns. The exotic Van cat that is a symbol of the city has thick white fur and eyes of one colour eachblue and green. The philatelic sections of major Turkish post offices have beautiful Van cat stamps for sale.

At Van İskelesi (Van Pier), friendly tea gardens and restaurants invite you for a break and Edremit, a holiday resort 14 km to the southwest, has nice beaches available for both swimming and camping. In the same direction is Gevaş, where you can visit a Seljuk cemetery with numerous decorated headstones and the lovely Halime Hatun Mausoleum.

“Van, the ancient Urartian capital of Tuşpa, tempts visitors with its location on the eastern shore of the lake with the same name.”

Lake Van, the largest lake of Turkey, is located at an altitude of 1720m and is ringed by beautiful mountains. Mount Süphan (4058m) is on the northwest side and the İhtiyar Şahap Mountains are to the south of the region. You can go around the lake, visiting several ancient Urartian sites as well as other places that represent the legacies of the various peoples who inhabited the area.

Some of the islands on Lake Van have monasteries and churches. Forty-one kilometres southwest of Van, Akdamar Island (a half-hour sail from shore) is the most important of these. On the island stands the 10th century Akdamar Church whose stone walls are richly carved with Old Testament scenes and figures. The church, hosting a religious ceremony once a year, now serves as a museum. After sightseeing, swimmers and picnickers can enjoy themselves around the island’s almond groves. Should you have time, visit Çarpanak Island to drink in its landscape and to wander around the 12th-century church, which is now a museum.

Among the interesting geographical features around Lake Van, the Muradiye Waterfalls, 88km north of Van, with a peaceful tea garden and restaurants and Gahnispi-Beyaz Çeşme Falls, 60km south of Van, are worth visiting.

Çavuştepe, 35km from Van on the Hakkari road, is an important Urartian citadel. It was excavated in 1970. Today you can see temples, a palace, a sacrificial altar and inscriptions there. On the pastoral, winding road to Hakkari, the Zernek Dam Lake offers itself as a resting spot on the way to Hoşap, 60km from Van, where a 17th century fairytale castle rises above a small hill. The interior is badly damaged, but the exterior walls, crenellations and turrets are well-preserved.

        "description" => "
Doğubazit is Turkey’s most eastern district bordering Iran and close to Mount Ararat. The town stands on a plain and is surrounded by Turkey’s highest mountains, including Mt Ararat which stands out majestically. The area has a rich history and monuments dating back to the Uratu Kingdom 2700 BC. Before the Turkish Republic the town was an Armenian stronghold and was referred to by its Armenian name Daroynk. Previously it was conquered by the Persians, Romans, Arabs and Byzantines who all used the plain to rest before passing through the mountains. Turks first arrived in 1064 followed by Mongols and more Turks.   After its conquest by the Ottomans in 1514 it was ruled by Turkish generals, including Ishak Pasa who built the palace that bears his name. The town saw fighting in the Ottoman-Russian war, was under attack by the Russians in 1856 and was taken by the Russians in 1877-1878. It was later ravaged during the Turkish War of İndependance. Most of the Armenian population left to build a new Beyazit at Lake Sevan. It was occupied by the Kurds in 1930 and destroyed during battles with the Turks.   A new town was built on the plain below the old site in 1930’s and given the amended name of Doğubeyazıt which means East Beyazit. Doğubeyazıt is the most easterly stop on our Eastern Turkey Tour.

Ishak Pasa Sarayi is located about 5km south of the city.   Built by Ishak Pasa during the 17th CAD the palace is beautiful and stands on a hill overlooking the Plain. The view of the surrounding plains is quite amazing. Nearby you can visit the tomb of Ahmedi Xani a Kurdish Poet and the ruins of the Urartian Castle. A meteor crater located near the Iranian Border is the result of a crash in 1892. It ıs the second biggest in the world with a width of 35 metres and depth of 60 metres. The Ice Cave is a natural monument 7-8 metres below ground and 100 metres long and 50 metres wide. The cave is hot in the winter and cold in the summer. There is a site that sits between the two villages of Telçeker and Uzengili that holds a giant imprint of an ark. Because of the resemblance it is claimed to be the final resting place of Noahs Ark. The site is protected and is visited by thousands of tourist each year.   Mt Ararat is in the north east corner of Doğubeyazit and is the highest peak in Turkey and higher than any peak in Europe. It can be climbed but only with permits and pre-arrangements.

Kars, a transit point between Anatolia and the Caucasus, has an outstanding beauty in itself, magnified by Ani Ruins- a medieval city once called “City of 1001 Churches”.

Kars is located at the transit point from Anatolia into the Caucasus. Visitors can enjoy its monumental structures and historical fabric. However, when making your travel plans, consider the season as it is covered with snow for much of the year!

The city centre of Kars looks quite different from the ones of other cities. Older than a century, most of magnificent and elegant buildings built during the Russian occupation lie on both sides of wide streets that crosscut one another. Being still in use, these structures add to the city’s architectural legacy.

The city unfolds at the foot of its impressive fortress from the 12th century. Nearby, the Havariler Church (the 10th-century Church of the Apostles) reveals a curious mixture of architectural influences. Bas-reliefs representing the 12 apostles in rather stiff and primitive poses ring the dome’s exterior drum. The Archaeological Museum exhibits beautiful wood carvings, an excellent collection of coins found in the surrounding region, as well as many ethnographic items. Kars is particularly known for its distinctive kilims (rugs) and carpets, and it retains a strong heritage of folk dancing that visitors always enjoy watching. On the mountain pastures villagers produce excellent kaşar cheese and delicious honey.

About 42km east of the city, the medieval city of Ani (Ocaklı) lies mostly in ruins on the ancient Silk Road. Inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List in 2016, the Ani ruins with numerous churches, mosques and caravanserais are encircled by impressive fortified walls.

After visiting Ani ruins, you can drop by the ski centre in Sarıkamış with resort hotels set in a scenic pine forest. The centre offers a skiing season of 120 days through a year. Sarıkamış and the surrounding area are suitable for alpine skiing, ski touring and cross-country skiing.

The city is endowed with a safe haven, a wetland, a feast to the eyes of birdwatchers called Lake Kuyucuk that shelters over 200 bird species. The birds stop over at this spectacular gift of nature for breeding, nesting and feeding during the migration seasons. Spring and autumn are the ideal seasons for seeing tens of bird species together. Besides attracting visitors’ attention to the natural riches it is home to, the region of Kuyucuk has many places like Kuyucuk Village that history and culture fans would very like to see. At every corner of the village you can come by traces of the Doukhobors (a Russian tribe) who came over from Russia during the Ottoman-Russian War. Lining up along the street, the old houses catches eyes and hearts with their striking architectural features. Among the other cultural heritages reflecting that very same period are a church, later a mosque, and the village school building.

Archaeological Site of Ani

Lying on a secluded plateau in the Turkish City of Kars, Ani is home to military, religious as well as residential buildings and fortifications which trail back hundreds of years. These structures reflect the characteristics of the medieval urbanism that was formed within centuries by Christians and Muslims. It grew into a magnificent capital of the Bagradit Armenian Kingdom in the 10th and 11th centuries CE with a population over one hundred thousand and gained economic power by controlling one branch of the Silk Road. Even after coming under the sovereignty of Byzantines, Seljuks, and Georgians, it kept playing a vital role as a significant crossroads for merchants. However, the city started to go into decline after the Mongol invasion and a destructive earthquake that occurred in 1319. Through the technically and artistically advanced structures of the region built between the 7th and 13th centuries CE, this archaeological site provides the modern-day archaeologists with valuable information that unveil the evolution of medieval architecture.

From Troy to Gallipoli

Çanakkale is an honourable resting place for the soldiers who lost their lives in Gelibolu.

The city of Çanakkale lies at the narrow 1200m entrance to the Çanakkale Strait (Dardanelles) that connects the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean. Passenger and car ferries run daily between Çanakkale on the Asian side and Eceabat and Kilitbahir on the European side. Yachts navigating the straits stop at the well-equipped Çanakkale Marina to allow tourists more time in the area. Hotels, restaurants and cafes along the promenade offer visitors a place to enjoy the harbour, as well as providing a view of the Kilitbahir Fortress and Çanakkale Archaeological Museum. What is more, the Archaeological Site of Troy was added to the World Heritage Cultural List of UNESCO, inviting history fans to its magnificent ancient settlement ruins.

In 1451 Sultan Mehmet II, the conqueror of İstanbul, built one fortress on the European side of the Çanakkale Strait at Kilitbahir and one on the opposite shore at Çimenlik to control the passage of ships through the strait. Today the Çimenlik Fortress serves as a military museum dedicated to the World War I Battles of Çanakkale.

The Historic National Park of the Gelibolu Peninsula was established to honour the 500,000 soldiers who lost their lives in Gelibolu, also known as Gallipoli. In 1915, Mustafa Kemal, the commander of the Turkish army, led a successful campaign to drive out allied powers from the area. The park accommodates memorials, monuments and cemeteries as well as the natural beauty of the Arıburnu Cliffs and Tuz Gölü (Salt Lake). The beauty of the green hills, sandy beaches and blue waters are an honourable resting place for the soldiers who bravely fought and died in this historic battle. One cannot help but sense the heart of the Turkish nation in the patriotic spirit of Gallipoli.

Archaeological Site of Troy

Contrary to popular opinion, the archaeological site of Troy does not embody just one ancient city. In fact, this site comprises the ruins of at least nine different settlements, built one on top of the other, dating back to the early Bronze Age. The first city was founded in the 3rd millenium BC and flourished as a mercantile city due to its location. This unique site enabled its inhabitants to control the Dardanelles (today’s Çanakkale Strait), a waterway which is used by every merchant ship passing from the Aegean Sea and heading for Black Sea. The extensive remains at this archaeological site are the most significant demonstration of the first contact between the civilizations of Anatolia and the Mediterranean world. Naturally, Troy is one of immense significance to understand the early development of European civilization at such critical stage. Moreover, Troy is of exceptional cultural importance because of the profound influence of Homer’s Iliad on the creative arts over more than two millenia.

Legends and Temples

Homer immortalized Troia (Troy) in his stories of King Priam, Hector, Paris and the beautiful Helen. Archaeological excavations have revealed nine separate periods of settlement here including ruins of city walls, house foundations, a temple and a theatre. A large and symbolic wooden Trojan horse marks the legendary war today. The ancient harbour of Alexandria-Troas was built in the 3rd century BC and St Paul passed through the city twice on his third missionary journey going on to Assos. The acropolis of Assos (Behramkale) is 238m above sea level, with the Temple of Athena being constructed on this site in the 6th century BC. This Doric temple is currently being restored to its former glory and role as guardian of the Biga Peninsula and Gulf of Edremit. Wander around to see the moonlight scattered through the temple ruins! Or rise early for the awakening dawn over the acropolis! From the top you can take in the magnificent vista of the Gulf of Edremit and appreciate this heavenly location. On the terraces descending to the sea are agoras, a gymnasium and a theatre and from the northern corner of the acropolis, you can see a mosque, a bridge and a fortress, all built by Sultan Murat I in the 14th century. Down below lies a tiny and idyllic ancient harbour. Assos has gained the reputation of being the centre of the Turkish artistic community with its lively, friendly and bohemian atmosphere – this may be the place you will always remember for years to come. In the village of Gülpınar, 25km west of Behramkale, is the ancient city of Chryse where the 2nd-century BC temple of Apollo is located. Babakale, a scenic village of houses terraced on a cliff which drops to the sea, is 15km west of Gülpınar that is located on an unmarked road that follows the jagged coastline.

Schliemann turned his dreams into reality; however, he destroyed much of Troy as a result of the unsystematic excavations which he carried out. He also took many of Troy’s precious artefacts out of Anatolia illegaly to the German city of Berlin.

After the 2nd World War, the artefacts, which were on display in the Museum Fur Vor-Und Frühgeschichte until 1940, were taken awaty to Russia as war treasures. In 1993, after many years of silence, Russia admitted that the treasures of Troy were in their country.

Other finds from the ancient city of Troy were also taken out of Turkey illegally over the years and dispersed among 50 different museums. The Republic of Turkey has been endeavouring to reclaim her cultural heritage for many years in accordance with the princible of UNESCO, which is that ‘every historic treasure should remain in its native country’.

The Republic of Turkey has organized various activities to introduce the Trojan artefacts of Anatolian Culture to the world. One such activity was the exhibition, “Troy-Dreams and Reality”, organized by Turkey and Germany in 2001 as a cultural and scientific co-operation. The artefacts carefully selected from the collections of 12 museums in Turkey, were sent to Germany for the exhibition. Hundreds of thousands of people saw these artefacts, and were introduced to the culture of which they are a product.

Although excavations in the Historic National Park of Troy are continuing, it is still possible to visit Troy. You can observe the excavations, and see the archaeological remains in their unique geographic location.

Archaeological finds, unearthed at the systematic excavation of Troy, are on display in the Museum of Çanakkale and the İstanbul Archaeological Museum, and these museums are an excellent source of further information on the area and its history.

Thousands of people visit Troy each year to see the artefacts and architectural remains of the 9 settlement periods.

Just by soaking up the atmosphere of the city, you can experience the spirit of Troy, theri imagination kindled by the replica wooden horse at the site.",

Dalyan is a beautiful river town located (and named after) the Dalyan River, which runs right into the The Mediterranean. It’s known for its stunning natural beauty, its beaches, the quaint town and the incredible ancient city of Kaunos.

The town has a very cosmopolitan feel, with residents from all over the world. The seafood restaurants right along the waterfront are a hotspot, but there’s a real nightlife to the town as well along its main strip, with stores staying open past midnight as happy couples take a late night stroll before stopping for a bite to eat or a drink or two. There are locals selling their wares, ice cream shops, and so much more it really makes for the perfect place to stroll through before a nice night’s sleep.

Kaunos

The ancient city of Kaunos, in Dalyan on the other side of Lake Köyceğiz, is a great place to start your exploration of the region. This ancient city was founded on the border between Lycia and Caria as one of the region’s major port cities. It changed hands many times and belonged to many different civilizations but was consistently a center of trade, culture and the arts. It was founded on a hill 152 meters above sea level, and the views of the King’s Tombs you see as you look out over the city are one of Turkey’s most iconic sights. These date back to the 4th -century B.C. and were designed in traditional Lycian style, featuring façades resembling a temple. The ruins of the walls cover 3 kilometers and inside the city, you’ll find an ancient theater, a church, a bathhouse and a temple.

Iztuzu

Dalyan is located at the edge of the canal and has what we call a lagoon made up of made of these stunning canals that lead to the beautiful crescent-shaped İztuzu Beach. The İztuzu coastline features fresh water in front of it and the beautiful sea behind. The coastline is a total of 5.5km and has been home to the Caretta Caretta loggerhead sea turtles for 3 million years. Due to the protection under which the Caretta Caretta turtles are placed, İztuzu Beach closes every evening. And every year thousands of these turtles lay their eggs here between the months of May and September.

An inspiration for world-renowned travellers like Xenophon, and Evliya Çelebi who immortalized Trabzon in his travel book.

Trabzon, whose history stretches back into very early times, is a hub of cultural and natural riches in the eastern Black Sea Region. Located on the historic Silk Road, the city has been a melting-pot of religions, languages and cultures for centuries. It played an important role in history due to its harbour and vital position on the legendary Silk Road. Such was its fame that Marco Polo visited the city in the 14th century. Trabzon has also been an inspiration for such other world-renowned travellers as Xenophon, Evliya Çelebi, Fallmerayer and Frunze, who visited the city and immortalized it in travel books and manuscripts.

Today, the city continues to be an important centre of commerce and culture, replete with museums, monasteries, mosques, tombs, caravanserais, bath-houses, a covered bazaar, city walls, and magnificent examples of civic architecture, markets and a fantastic landscape.

The restored 13th-century Byzantine church of Hagia Sophia, now the Ayasofya Mosque, is the jewel of Trabzon’s Christian monuments. Another gem is the Sumela Monastery overlooking the valley of Altındere, 54km or so south of Trabzon. It is located in Altındere National Park, set amidst the rich flora and fascinating geomorphologic formations of the Altındere Valley. The monastery is perched on the face of a cliff 270m above a deep gorge and it seems from the valley floor to be floating between earth and sky. Surrounded by the ruins of the monks’ dwellings, the monastery’s main chapel is covered with brilliant frescoes both on the inside and outside. It is an exceptional site not only for the singularity of its construction but also for its magnificence. As to the construction of the Sumela Monastery, the legend says one day the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared in a vision to two Athenian monks and asked them to build a monastery in an isolated valley.

To the far east of the Sumela Monastery, the Çamburnu Coast, where migrating birds rest amidst the golden pine trees, is a lovely area for those who would like to have a short break for photographing the wavy sea.

One of the symbols of Trabzon is the Uzungöl Nature Park located 95km from the city. The park has a rich flora and stunning wildlife, and is an area of outstanding natural beauty. There are accommodation facilities, picnic areas and trekking routes for visitors.

Besides natural wonders, Trabzon dazzles the visitors also with a cuisine of considerable charm that offers in the city restaurants many local dishes of great flavour found nowhere else in the world.

The Roof of Anatolia

Believed to be the lands where humankind expanded from the descendants of Noah, Ağrı invites you to İshakpaşa Palace, an emblematic of Ottoman architectural culture.

Along the eastern borders of Turkey is Ağrı, one of the important cities of the region. Set on a 1650m-high plateau, it takes its name from the mountain which looms over it. Mount Ağrı is Turkey’s highest mountain and one of the country’s most challenging peaks. According to the legend of the Great Flood, Noah’s Ark ran aground on Mt Ağrı and when the flood waters receded Noah and his family descended from the mountain towards the fertile Iğdır Plain. Thereafter, their descendants moved west and southwest along the Fırat (Euphrates) and Dicle (Tigris) rivers, thus establishing the second generation of humankind. Mt Ağrı is capped with snow all year round; however, climbing up this mountain is most enjoyable during July to September.

The pleasant Balık Gölü (Fish Lake) to the northeast of the city not surprisingly has plenty of fish restaurants serving local delicacies. Thermal springs bubble up all over the area. Those who enjoy hardy outdoor activities can pay a visit to the Eleşkirt Ski Centre, 20km southwest of Ağrı, where they can spend a few days doing winter sports.

Don’t miss the spectacular İshakpaşa Palace, lying silent 5km from Doğubayazıt county and 95km east from Ağrı. İshak Pasha, Ottoman governor of the province, and Çolak Abdi Pasha constructed the palace between 1685 and 1784 combining Ottoman, Persian and Seljuk architectural styles. The palace contains 366 rooms, a mosque, a courtroom, a kitchen, a bakery, barns and baths. Nearby you can see a bas-relief of an Urartian king and a rock tomb from the ninth century BC.

The village of Üzengili, 25km east of Doğubayazıt, is a great place to taste the local dessert aşure (Noah’s Pudding), believed to have been first made by Noah’s wife from the last bits of the food in the Ark.

A 35km wide and 60m deep meteor crater, formed in the early 1900s somewhere between Sarıçevuş Village and the Turkish-Iranian border post of Gürbulak, awaits to bedazzle visitors with its hypnotizing appearance.
