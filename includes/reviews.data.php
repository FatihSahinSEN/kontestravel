Gaye from TurkeyTravel.com had organised the tour exclusively for us. Our tour guide Huseyin Aydin accompanied us throughout the tour and was a wealth of information. Some places we visited were Ephesus, Pamukkale, Cappadocia among others. But It was the experiences such as a mud bath, hot air ballooning, sailing and swimming the Meditteranean, walking through ancient ruins that remain as memories to be cherished. The tour was extremely well organised thanks to a team of professional and experienced people who have the best interests of their clients at heart.&#8221;",

No knowing much about this county we contacted TurkeyTravel.com to help us with suggestions, They put together a great plan for us not only in Istanbul but our days spent travelling around. Our tour included Cappadocia Ephesus and Pamukkale and it all worked seemlessly. They looked after us all the way around and organised great hotels not to mention our balloon flight which was a highlight. Highly recommended for those who need a personalised trip rather than joining a bigger tour, Thanks Gaye and Erdal for making our time in Turkey memorable.”",

Gaye made suggestions and we ended up with a 6 day itinerary including Ephesus, Pamukkale, Cappadocia, Antalya, etc. We were a little apprehensive initially as travel between locations was on public transport (plane, bus) and prearranged contacts with mini tour guides had to occur. However everything ran like clockwork, hotels were perfect, tour groups were small and guides very knowledgeable, and the bus transport enjoyable. Erdal in Istanbul talked us through the itinerary before we started and gave us his 24 hour contact no in case of problems but it was not required. All in all it was a fantastic way of visiting what we wanted to see without the hassle of large bus groups.\"",

With only 2 weeks notice they pulled together a suitable itinerary based on our requirements and their suggestions. Accommodation, connections and tours (group and private) exceeded our expectations. Service was excellent. The highlight was Cappadocia in a real cave hotel (family run) and the sunrise balloon ride. Gaye and her team looked after us from start to finish. And there was even vegemite for breakfast for us Aussies! It was great communicating with an Aussie with english as first language and who had extensive first hand knowledge of Turkey (she lives there). Other options we had looked at were lesser quality for same price. Thanks for a great time!”",

We thoroughly enjoyed our five night stay at the Ayasofya in Istanbul – a great way to start and finish our trip. Nightly drinks on the terrace were a wonderful way to meet fellow travellers. We were very well looked after on our customised trip and we have many amazing and fond memories of Turkey. Due to your experience, personalised attention and first-hand knowledge there were numerous highlights on our trip (ballooning in Cappadocia, a day walking the Lycian Way, boating on the turquoise waters off Kas, strolling through Aphrodisias with an expert guide but without other tourists in sight, to name a few). Our tailored 11 day tour travelling through Turkey was hassle free – great hotels, knowledgeable guides, insightful tours, many wonderful experiences, smooth transfers and capable drivers. Our trip included private and small group tours and we visited wonderful places and sights that we would have missed had we planned the trip ourselves. The itinerary was a perfect balance – a blend of the must see sights, as well as those beyond the tourist trail. We had a fantastic mix of history, scenery and culture. Thank you, Gaye, Erdal and the team for your organisation and high standard of service. We will be back to explore more of this beautiful country.\"",

Two weeks of exploring and adventuring throughout Turkey and I was amazed by what I saw in Turkey. The trip itinerary was jam packed with loads of exciting and interesting adventures with just enough time in each place to experience the wonders of Turkey. I can’t wait to get there again. Gaye and her team were very accommodating and saw to all our needs. I felt like I was on a trip with family and friends. Gaye has so much knowledge of Turkey and knows where the best places to shop and sight see are so you can be sure your trip will be filled with greatness. If you are planning a trip to Turkey, or even if you aren’t, put it on your bucket list and contact Gaye to arrange a personalised tour to suit your needs. It wasn’t expensive either and we didn’t have to worry about a thing once we got there. Everything was organised. The tour guides speak English very well and know the history of the country very well. It was a fabulous trip and I highly recommend a tour through Turkey, organised through Turkeytravel.com. You won’t be disappointed! ”",

After landing in Istanbul late Friday the 7th September 2018 without any plans or bookings we contacted you (via your website) on the Saturday morning. Within an hour you responded and we arranged to meet you that day around midday. Within the subsequent 3 hours, you invited us back to your office and plans to do a 5 day tour starting on Tuesday (2.5 days later) had been agreed too and paid for. On Monday the day before our departure you met us at our hotel with the itinerary outlining all flight, hotel and transfer details which was amazing given the short time frame. Firstly, what we really appreciated about the trip is that everything was well organised it went like clockwork and at no stage did we have to worry or think about our schedule. Secondly and more importantly the sites, people, food and accommodation was amazing. what surprised us the most was the varied history of the country and the number (and yet to be discovered) ancient ruins that exist within Turkey. Finally at all times we felt secure and perplexed by the level of travel warnings that exist for Turkey. We cannot thank you enough for arranging the tour and we will not hesitate in recommending you to family and friends. ”",
